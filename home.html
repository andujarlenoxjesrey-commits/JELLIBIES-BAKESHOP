    <!-- OWNER / FOUNDER FEATURE -->
    <div class="history-title">LIFE OF THE FOUNDER</div>

    <div class="history-text">
        <b>Sol Anoba Debarra</b> was born on <b>June 27, 1997</b>, in <b>Guiwang, Alcoy</b>, and is now <b>28 years old</b>.
        She was not able to pursue college, but she started working at <b>Arbees Bakeshop</b> at a young age as a 
        <b>collector</b>. It was in Arbees where she met her future husband, who worked as a skilled baker.<br><br>

        As they worked together, they eventually shared one simple question that sparked everything:  
        <b>"Why not start our own bakeshop?"</b> and thats the beginning of all
    </div>
    
    <!-- SUCCESS STORY -->
    <div class="history-title">SUCCESS STORY OF JELLIBIES BAKESHOP</div>

    <div class="history-text">
        The journey of Jellibies Bakeshop grew from a simple idea into a thriving business. 
        After working at <b>Arbees Bakeshop</b>, Sol and her husband learned important lessons 
        about bakery operations, customer service, and the value of hard work. Their experience 
        in Arbees became the foundation that guided them toward building their own brand.<br><br>

        Sol’s sisters, <b>Lenicita Andujar</b> and <b>Lolita Paraqueles</b>, believed in the vision and decided 
        to invest. With their support and financial contribution, the business gained the strength 
        it needed to start.<br><br>

        Through teamwork, dedication, and the skills learned from Arbees, the small dream grew into a 
        successful and expanding bakeshop. Today, Sol, her husband, and her sisters proudly stand 
        together as co-partners, managing Jellibies Bakeshop as a corporation with multiple branches 
        serving the community.

    <!-- CHALLENGES FACED -->
    <div class="history-title">CHALLENGES FACED BY THE FOUNDER/OWNER</div>

    <div class="history-text">
        Starting Jellibies Bakeshop was not easy. One of the first challenges Sol faced 
        was finding the right baking equipment, which required a large amount of money 
        to purchase. As a beginner in business, gathering complete tools and machines 
        became a major obstacle.<br><br>

        Another struggle was the cost of rental for their first space. The rent was 
        expensive, and managing the monthly payment became a heavy burden during the 
        early stages of the business.<br><br>

        Despite these difficulties, Sol did not give up. With the help and support of 
        her sisters—who contributed financially and believed in her dream—the business 
        was able to push through. Their teamwork and determination allowed them to 
        overcome the challenges and continue growing Jellibies Bakeshop into what it 
        is today.

    <!-- GOVERNMENT SUPPORT -->
    <div class="history-title">HOW THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT HELPED THE BUSINESS GROW</div>

    <div class="history-text">
        The Philippine government helped Jellibies Bakeshop grow by allowing it to operate as a 
        legal and registered business. The bakeshop registered with the <b>Bureau of Internal 
        Revenue (BIR)</b>, which made the business official and trusted by customers and suppliers.<br><br>

        Other important permits were also secured, such as the <b>Barangay Clearance</b>, 
        <b>Mayor’s Permit</b>, and <b>Sanitary Permit</b>. These permits ensured that the business 
        followed local rules, maintained cleanliness, and provided safe food for customers.<br><br>

        With these government requirements and guidance, Jellibies Bakeshop was able to operate 
        smoothly, gain customer trust, and continue growing as a responsible local business.
